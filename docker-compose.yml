# Configuration is now managed via YAML files in ./config/
# See config/configuration.yml.example and config/secrets.yml.example
# 
# For migration from environment variables or .env files:
# The service will automatically create YAML files on first run if they don't exist
#
# IMPORTANT: Permission Issues
# If you encounter permission errors, ensure the ./config directory is owned by UID 1000:
#   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./config
# Alternatively, set FIX_PERMISSIONS=true in the environment section above
