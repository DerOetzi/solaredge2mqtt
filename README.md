The SolarEdge2MQTT service is a project designed to read power data from a SolarEdge inverter and publish it to an MQTT broker. The service is useful for integrating SolarEdge inverters into home automation systems or other applications that use MQTT for data exchange. It provides real-time monitoring of power flow and other parameters from the inverter via Modbus. 

You can also gather the panels' energy production data from the SolarEdge monitoring site. This feature is optional and does not use the API, but rather your monitoring platform account.

The SolarEdge Wallbox can be monitored as well via REST API.

Additionally all values can be saved for visualization into a InfluxDB.

*The SolarEdge2MQTT service is currently in an early stage of development. While it is functional and can be used to read data from a SolarEdge inverter and publish it to an MQTT broker, it is still undergoing active development. Features may be added, removed, or changed, and there may be bugs. Users should be aware of this and use the service with caution. Despite its early state, the project is open-source and contributions are welcome.*

### Service configuration

The service is configured by environment variables. The following options can be set:

Environment Variable             | default (production/development) | description

If you want to get panel energy values from the SolarEdge monitoring platform, add additional parameters.

Environment Variable             | description

If you want to monitor the power values of your SolarEdge Wallbox, add additional parameters. The Wallbox needs to have firmware version >= 1.15.0 and activated REST API. 

Environment Variable             | description                                            
-------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------

SE2MQTT_WALLBOX_PASSWORD         | The password of user `admin` you use to login the Web UI of your Wallbox
SE2MQTT_WALLBOX_SERIAL           | The serial number of your wallbox

If you want to save the monitoring data to a InfluxDB you have to generate a full access token, because the service will generate two buckets and a task for you.

The first bucket (raw) is used to store every interval the data of the components `inverter`, `meters`, `batteries` and `wallbox` to a measurement called `component` and the current `powerflow` state. This can be useful for debugging reasons. The generated aggregation task will store the `energy` values of every minute to this bucket. By default this bucket holds the values for 24h.

The second bucket is used by the aggregation task to store the `powerflow` states and `energy` values aggregated by 1 hour intervals. By default this bucket holds the values for 2 years.

#### Example configuration

You can download [.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerOetzi/solaredge2mqtt/master/.env.example) and rename it to `.env`. Inside, you can modify the default configuration values to meet your needs in this file.

## Run the service 

### In the console

Copy the [.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerOetzi/solaredge2mqtt/master/.env.example) file to .env and modify it according to your needs.

Then, simply run `solaredge2mqtt` to start the service.

### With docker:

```
docker run --name solaredge2mqtt --rm \
    -e "SE2MQTT_MODBUS_HOST=<INVERTER_IP>" \
    -e "SE2MQTT_BROKER=<BROKER_IP>" \
    -e "SE2MQTT_USERNAME=<MQTT_USERNAME>" \
    -e "SE2MQTT_PASSWORD=<MQTT_PASSWORD>" \
    -e "TZ=Europe/Berlin" \
    ghcr.io/deroetzi/solaredge2mqtt:latest
```

Add optional environment arguments from above to fit to your setup.

### With docker-compose

Copy the [.env.example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerOetzi/solaredge2mqtt/master/.env.example) file to `.env` and modify it according to your needs.

Get the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerOetzi/solaredge2mqtt/master/docker/docker-compose.yml) file.

Generate a `.secrets` directory and put at least a file called `mqtt_password` inside with your MQTT broker password.

If you want to use module energy values additionally, uncomment the secrets parts for the `se2mqtt_api_password` secret inside the `docker-compose.yml` and put a `api_password` file in the `.secrets` directory as well. Same applies for `wallbox_password` and `influxdb_token`

Run the docker container

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Stop the docker container

```
docker-compose down
```
